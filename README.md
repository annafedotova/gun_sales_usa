# Analysis of gun sales in the USA, 1998 - 2018

## Introduction
This project explores the trends and tendencies of gun sales in the USA in the past 20 years. As a proxy for gun sales the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS) information about background checks performed through the system is being used. You can find the main dataset that is being explored in [this Github repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks).

## Questions

- What are the overall trends and tendencies of gun purchases?
- What is the split of sales by gun type?
- Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations?
- What census data is most associated with high level of background checks per capita?
